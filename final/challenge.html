		<h1>Advanced Versions of Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
		<div id="muk-jji-ppa">
			<h2>Variation - 묵찌빠 / Muk-Jji-Ppa</h2>
			<p>
				As mentioned on the <a href="play.html#korean-rps">Play page</a>,
				there is an advanced version of Rock, Paper, Scissors played in Korea
				called 묵찌빠 (Muk-Jji-Ppa). Muk-Jji-Ppa takes the fast pace of Korean
				Rock, Paper, Scissors and adds an attacking and defensive role.
			</p>
			<p>
				Muk-Jji-Ppa starts with a regular game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the
				winner taking the attacking position. The attacker's goal is to make
				the defender throw the same sign as the attacker, but the attacker must
				announce their sign as they throw it, and the defender must immediately
				throw as well. Each round of throws happens right after each other,
				like how Korean Rock, Paper, Scissors handles tied throws.
			</p>
			<p>
				While the attacker is trying to get the defender to throw the same sign
				as them, the defender is trying to throw the sign that beats the attacker,
				giving them the role of attacker in the next rounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				As an example, imagine a game of Muk-Jji-Ppa between Kevin and Adam. They
				play a normal round of Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine who starts as the
				attacker. Kevin wins, giving him the role of the attacker.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kevin decides that he is going to play rock, so calls out "Rock" while
				making the sign. Adam has decided to play scissors, and throws his sign at
				the same time. Because Kevin and Adam threw different signs, the game
				continues. Since Kevin's rock beats Adam's scissors, Kevin continues as the
				attacker.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the next round, Kevin decides to change to paper, so calls "Paper" as he
				throws the sign. Adam had decided to stick with scissors and throws his sign
				with Kevin. Because Adam's scissors beat Kevin's paper, Adam becomes the
				attacker.
			</p>
			<p>
				Adam decides he is going to throw paper, and so calls "Paper" while making
				the sign. Kevin had chosen to throw paper as well, and because his sign
				matches Adam's, Adam wins.
			</p>

			<h2>101-Object Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
			<p>If 11 objects wasn't enough of a challenge, from David Lovelace again, we
				get the 101-Object variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each object can beat
				50 other objects and is beaten by 50 other objects. Hover over each object
				to see what it beats, and when you click one, the computer will randomly
				select one as well.
